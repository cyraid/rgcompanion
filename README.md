# Ruffle Game Companion App

## About

A Companion App for Ruffle Game. For more information on Ruffle Game, please see

## Instructions

Copy `ruffle.exe` (or `ruffle_desktop.exe` if you built it yourself) from
Ruffle Game, and place in the rgcompanion/assets folder as `assets/ruffle_game.exe`.
If you're not sure you have the right Ruffle, run the exe and if it says
"Placeholder" you have the right one!

This exe is used to output new executables with the Embedded SWF, Title, and Icon
replaced.
